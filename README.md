# my-django-crud
A basic Django Application which has the basic functions of Create, Read, Update and Delete

# Summary

As a beginner in using Python/Django, I think the best way to learn is by doing it. I "did" finish the basic django polls applications but I want something more than that. I would want to develop a much bigger project than this so-called "CRUD" but everything starts from small things. So, I think I'll start small by just using plain django and have it uploaded to the web.

Feel free to criticize my work!
